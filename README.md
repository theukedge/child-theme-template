# Child Theme Template

This is a basic template for your child theme, setting the stage for you to be able to build your own child theme, enabling you to make changes to a theme on your site without risking losing your changes when you need to update your theme.

This theme is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/theukedge/child-theme-template).

## How to use this theme

There are very elaborate instructions on my "[Putting Things Where They Belong](http://www.doitwithwp.com/putting-things-where-they-belong/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=content)" tutorial, but in short:

* Open style.css
* Add the folder name of the parent theme to the "template" field
* Upload to your site
* Activate

At first, nothing will look any different, because there are no customisations. This is where you come in. Start adding new styles, functionality and layouts to suit your needs.
